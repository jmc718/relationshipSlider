    <h1>About Glaze Shield</h1>

  </header>
  <p>
    <strong>Basic Info:</strong> Glaze Shield is a Canterlot Royal Guard, but his true passion is cooking and baking. <br> <br>
    As a p√¢tissier, he dreams of one day opening his own bake shop. He feels at his best while baking and tends to
    have a cheerful, good-natured, and humorous mood to match. <br><br>
    As a royal guard, he's been through a lot. He didn't have the same talents as others on the guard and struggled
    to find his place. He was at the invasion of Canterlot and saw many comrades fall that day. Some of which he knew
    well. He vowed to grow strong enough to protect his allies and to never let anything like that happen again.
