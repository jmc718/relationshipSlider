  <p>
    <strong>0:</strong>  Then pay with your blood. Equestria has no use for your kind. <br>
    <strong>1:</strong>  You have committed crimes against Equestria and her people. What say you in your defense? <br>
    <strong>2:</strong>  Is that so? Well then, I'll have to charge you with disturbing the Princess's peace. <br>
    <strong>3:</strong>  Hmm. I still don't like it, but I guess I'll overlook it. This time. <br>
    <strong>4:</strong>  Let me guess... someone stole your sweetroll. <br>
    <strong>5:</strong>  Citizen. <br>
    <strong>6:</strong>  Staying safe I hope. <br>
    <strong>7:</strong>  Fear not. Come dragon or giant, we'll be ready. <br>
    <strong>8:</strong>  How can I help a brother Equestrian? <br>
    <strong>9:</strong>  How do you do, thane? <br>
    <strong>10:</strong> No matter what else happens, the guards will always be grateful for everything you've done.
